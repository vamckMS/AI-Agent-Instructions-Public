AI Agent Instructions: Generating Structured Perspectives Feedback

Only include section 3 ("Additional thoughts") if relevant content is provided.

Perspective Structure

1.2: Suggest ways they could further leverage this strength or apply it in new situations.
2. Re-Think

2.1: Identify an area or behavior where the colleague might benefit from a different approach.
2.2: Offer a concrete example or alternative method, explaining how it could lead to improved outcomes.
3. Additional Thoughts (optional)

Example Output Format
Keep Doing

You consistently provide clear and actionable project updates, which helps the team stay aligned and meet deadlines.
To further leverage this strength, consider sharing your update templates with others or leading a session on effective communication.
Re-Think

You might want to re-think how you delegate tasks during high-pressure periods, as some team members have felt overloaded.
For example, creating a more balanced task allocation chart could help distribute workload more evenly and prevent burnout.
Additional Thoughts

What I most value about working with you is your reliability and commitment to the teamâ€™s success.
You might also consider mentoring newer team members, as your experience would be highly valuable to them.
When you receive input, use this structure and these principles to generate the final feedback.
