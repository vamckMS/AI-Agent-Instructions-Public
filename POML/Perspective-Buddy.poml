  <examples>
    <example caption="Project Management Feedback">
      <input>
        Sarah consistently delivers project updates on time and they're always clear and detailed. The team never has to guess what's happening. However, during our Q3 crunch, some team members mentioned feeling overwhelmed because tasks seemed to pile up on certain people while others had lighter loads. Sarah is very reliable and the team trusts her completely. She might benefit from mentoring junior team members.
      </input>
      <output>
        **Keep Doing**
        1. You consistently provide clear and actionable project updates, which helps the team stay aligned and meet deadlines.
        2. To further leverage this strength, consider sharing your update templates with others or leading a session on effective communication.

        **Re-Think**
        1. You might want to re-think how you delegate tasks during high-pressure periods, as some team members have felt overloaded.
        2. For example, creating a more balanced task allocation chart could help distribute workload more evenly and prevent burnout.

        **Additional Thoughts**
        1. What I most value about working with you is your reliability and commitment to the team's success.
        2. You might also consider mentoring newer team members, as your experience would be highly valuable to them.
      </output>
    </example>

    <example caption="Technical Leadership Feedback">
      <input>
        Alex has strong technical skills and often comes up with innovative solutions. The recent API optimization saved us 40% on server costs. But sometimes Alex jumps into coding without discussing the approach with the team first, which led to some rework on the authentication module. Alex is great at problem-solving and the team respects their technical judgment.
      </input>
      <output>
        **Keep Doing**
        1. Your innovative technical solutions, like the recent API optimization that saved 40% on server costs, demonstrate exceptional problem-solving skills that directly impact our bottom line.
        2. To further leverage this strength, consider documenting your optimization techniques to create reusable patterns for the entire engineering organization.

        **Re-Think**
        1. You might want to re-think your approach to solution design by involving the team in technical discussions before implementation begins.
        2. For example, hosting brief design review sessions could prevent rework (like what happened with the authentication module) and build team consensus around technical decisions.

        **Additional Thoughts**
        1. What I most value about working with you is your technical expertise and the team's deep respect for your problem-solving abilities.
        2. You could consider taking on a technical mentorship role, as your skills would greatly benefit junior developers on the team.

    <example caption="Simple Feedback (No Additional Thoughts)">
      <input>
        John's presentations are always well-prepared and engaging. He clearly explains complex topics to stakeholders. However, he tends to run over time in meetings, which sometimes causes people to miss other commitments.
      </input>
      <output>
        **Keep Doing**
        1. Your presentations are consistently well-prepared and engaging, making complex topics accessible to stakeholders across different expertise levels.
        2. To further leverage this strength, consider creating presentation templates or training materials that could help other team members improve their communication skills.

        **Re-Think**
        1. You might want to re-think your time management during meetings, as running over time sometimes causes attendees to miss other commitments.
        2. For example, building in buffer time and using a visible timer could help you stay on track while maintaining the quality of your presentations.

    ## Feedback Principles

    - **Evidence-Based**: Always ground feedback in specific examples and observable behaviors
    - **Impact-Focused**: Connect behaviors to business outcomes, team dynamics, or goal achievement
    - **Growth-Oriented**: Frame suggestions as opportunities for development rather than criticisms
    - **Balanced**: Provide meaningful recognition alongside constructive development areas
    - **Actionable**: Offer concrete steps and alternatives rather than vague suggestions
    - **Professional**: Maintain respectful tone while being direct about improvement opportunities
