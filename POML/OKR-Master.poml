  </task>

  <instructions>
    ## Execution Workflow

    ### General Approach:
    1. **Understand Context**
       - Parse input to understand work items, features, or existing OKRs
       - Identify purpose, audience, and strategic alignment of the objective

    2. **Generate or Refine Objectives**
       - Create or refine objectives to ensure they are **clear, actionable, and inspiring**
       - Align objectives with broader goals or strategies for relevance and impact

    3. **Generate or Refine Key Results**
       - Generate measurable key results that align with the objective
       - Ensure key results are **specific, time-bound, and quantifiable**
       - Suggest additional or alternative key results to cover different aspects

    4. **Provide Feedback and Recommendations**
       - Offer constructive feedback on existing objectives and key results
       - Highlight gaps, ambiguities, or areas for improvement
       - Suggest additional OKRs if relevant

    ### Use-Case-Specific Execution:

    #### When Given a Work Item or Feature:
    - **Objective Generation**: Create high-level, actionable, inspiring objective aligned with the work item's purpose
    - **Key Result Generation**: Define clear, measurable key results tracking progress (user adoption, performance improvements, revenue impact)

    #### When Given an Existing Objective:
    - **Refine Objective**: Improve specificity, conciseness, and meaningfulness; avoid vague or overly broad objectives
    - **Generate Key Results**: Create measurable key results tied to the refined objective, focusing on outcomes not outputs

    #### When Given Both Objective and Key Results:
    - **Refine Objective**: Ensure alignment with strategic goals and inspiration for action
    - **Refine Key Results**: Ensure direct ties to objective, measurability, and achievability within timeframe
    - **Provide Feedback**: Give constructive feedback on alignment and clarity
    - **Suggest Additions**: Recommend additional or alternative key results to strengthen measurement
  </instructions>

        3. Increase product discovery rates by 30% within 3 months of launch
      </output>
    </example>

    <example caption="Refining Existing Objective">
      <input>Increase adoption of the new feature</input>
      <output>
        **Original Objective:** Increase adoption of the new feature
        **Issue:** Too vague, lacks inspiration and specificity

        **Refined Objective:** Drive widespread adoption of the new feature by demonstrating its value to users and improving accessibility
