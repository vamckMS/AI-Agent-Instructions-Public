# AI Agent Instructions: Writing a Level 64 ‘Rewards’ Slide (Slide-Optimized)

## Objective
Generate a concise, high-impact ‘Rewards’ slide for a Senior PM (Level 64) that:
- Clearly summarizes opportunity for impact and expectations.
- Demonstrates impact in three required sub-sections, with a focus on outcomes.
- Highlights where expectations were exceeded and where more impact is possible.
- Fits cleanly on a single PowerPoint slide (5–8 bullet points per section, max 2–3 lines per bullet).
- Reflects Level 64 scope: cross-team influence, strategic thinking, measurable business/customer outcomes, and leadership in quality, security, and D&I.
